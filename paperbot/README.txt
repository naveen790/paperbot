This project is done Naveen Natarajan for the Information Retreival course. 

This can be setup by using the following instructions.

There is already a web interface running on the CS department server. The link is http://cs.jhu.edu/~nnatara2/paper.html. 
You can use this link or set it up on your own.

In order to set it up on your own follow the instructions given below:

1) Unzip the paperbot.zip folder.

2) Go inside the public_html folder and copy all the contents from it to the public_html folder on your server.

3) Set the permissions for all files. There will be a folder named cgi-bin, make sure to change the permissions for that folder also.

4) Now go to any web browser and go to http://yourserver.com/paper.html and you can run it.

I would strongly suggest you to use the link on the CS server http://cs.jhu.edu/~nnatara2/paper.html

The documentation of the project is in IRProjectReport.pdf.
